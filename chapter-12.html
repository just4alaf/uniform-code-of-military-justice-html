<p>section shall be paid that annuity if, at the time he becomes</p>
<p>eligible to receive that annuity, he elects to receive that</p>
<p>annuity in lieu of any other annuity for which he may be eligible</p>
<p>at the time of such election (whether an immediate or a deferred</p>
<p>annuity) under subchapter III of chapter 83 or subchapter II of</p>
<p>chapter 84 of title 5 or any other retirement system for civilian</p>
<p>employees of the Federal Government.  Such an election may not be</p>
<p>revoked.</p>
<p>(3)     (A) The Secretary of Defense shall notify the Director</p>
<p>of the Office of Personnel Management whenever an</p>
<p>election under paragraph (2) is made affecting any</p>
<p>right or interest under subchapter III of chapter 83 or</p>
<p>subchapter II of chapter 85 of title 5 based on service</p>
<p>as a judge of the United States Court of Military</p>
<p>Appeals.</p>
<p>(B) Upon receiving any notification under subparagraph</p>
<p>(A) in the case of a person making an election under</p>
<p>(2), the Director shall determine the amount  of the</p>
<p>person&#x27;s lump-sum credit under subchapter III of</p>
<p>chapter 83 or subchapter II of chapter 84 of title 5,</p>
<p>as applicable, and shall request the Secretary of</p>
<p>Treasury to transfer such amount from the Civil Service</p>

<p>under section 8331(8) of title 5 for purposes of this</p>
<p>paragraph--</p>
<p>(i) interest shall be computed using the rates</p>
<p>under section 8334(e)(3) of such title; and</p>

<p>(or longer) shall not be a basis for excluding</p>
<p>interest.</p>
<p>(b) AMOUNT OF ANNUITY. The annuity payable under this section</p>
<p>to a person who makes an election under subsection (a)(2) is 80</p>

<p>subsection (a)(2). That program shall, to the maximum extent</p>
<p>practicable, provide benefits and establish terms and conditions</p>
<p>that are similar to those provided under survivor and former</p>
<p>spouse annuity programs under other retirement systems for</p>
<p>civilian employees of the Federal Government.  The program may</p>
<p>include provisions for the reduction in the annuity paid the</p>
<p>person as a condition for the survivor annuity.  An election by a</p>
<p>judge (including a senior judge) or former judge to receive an</p>
<p>annuity under this section terminates any right or interest which</p>
<p>any other individual may have to a survivor annuity under any</p>
<p>other retirement system for civilian employees of the Federal</p>
<p>Government based on the service of that judge or former judge as</p>

<p>this section in order to take account of changes in the cost of</p>
<p>living.  The Secretary shall prescribe by regulation procedures</p>
<p>for increases in annuities under this section.  Such system</p>
<p>shall, to the maximum extent appropriate, provide cost-of-living</p>
<p>adjustments that are similar to those that are provided under</p>
<p>other retirement systems for civilian employees of the Federal</p>
<p>Government.</p>
<p>(f) DUAL COMPENSATION. A person who is receiving an annuity</p>
<p>under this section by reason of service as a judge of the court</p>
<p>and who is appointed to a position in the Federal Government</p>
<p>shall, during the period of such person&#x27;s service in such</p>
<p>position, be entitled to receive only the annuity under this</p>
<p>section or the pay for that position, whichever is higher.</p>

<p>from regular service in that office, shall be paid either--</p>

<p>reason of his service as such a justice or judge of the</p>

<p>person at the time of his retirement from the office,</p>
<p>or from regular active service in the office, of</p>

<p>election may not be revoked.</p>
<p>(2) An election by a person to be paid an annuity or salary</p>
<p>pursuant to paragraph (1)(B) terminates (A) any election</p>
<p>previously made by such person to provide a survivor annuity</p>
<p>pursuant to subsection (d), and (B) any right of any other</p>
<p>individual to receive an survivor annuity pursuant to subsection</p>
