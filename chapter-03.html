<h1>SUBCHAPTER III. NON-JUDICIAL PUNISHMENT</h1><h3 id="815-art-15-commanding-officers-non-judicial-punishment">815. ART. 15. COMMANDING OFFICER&#x27;S NON-JUDICIAL PUNISHMENT<a class="article-anchor" href="#815-art-15-commanding-officers-non-judicial-punishment">#</a></h3><p>(a) Under such regulations as the President may prescribe, and under such</p>
<p>additional regulations as may be prescribed by the Secretary concerned,</p>
<p>limitations may be placed on the powers granted by this article with</p>
<p>respect to the kind and amount of punishment authorized, the categories of</p>
<p>commanding officers and warrant officers exercising command authorized to</p>
<p>exercise those powers, the applicability of this article to an accused who</p>
<p>demands trial by court-martial, and the kinds of courts-martial to which</p>
<p>the case may be referred upon such a demand.  However, except in the case</p>
<p>of a member attached to or embarked in a vessel, punishment may not be</p>
<p>imposed upon any member of the armed forces under this article if the</p>
<p>member has, before the imposition of such punishment, demanded trial by</p>
<p>court-martial in lieu of such punishment.  Under similar regulations, rules</p>
<p>may be prescribed with respect to the suspension of punishments authorized</p>
<p>by regulations of the Secretary concerned, a commanding officer exercising</p>
<p>general court-martial jurisdiction or an officer of general or flag rank in</p>
<p>command may delegate his powers under this article to a principal</p>
<p>assistant.</p>
<p>(b) Subject to subsection (a) any commanding officer may, in addition to</p>
<p>or in lieu of admonition or reprimand, impose one or more of the following</p>
<p>disciplinary punishments for minor offenses without the intervention of a</p>
<p>court-martial--</p>
<p>(1) upon officers of his command--</p>
<p>(A) restriction to certain specified limits, with or without</p>
<p>suspension from duty, for not more that 30 consecutive days;</p>
<p>(B) if imposed by an officer exercising general court-martial</p>
<p>jurisdictions or an officer of general flag rank in command--</p>
<p>(i) arrest in quarters for not more than 30 consecutive</p>
<p>days;</p>
<p>(ii) forfeiture of not more than one-half of one month&#x27;s pay</p>
<p>per month for two months;</p>
<p>(iii) restriction to certain specified limits, with or</p>
<p>without suspension from duty, for not more than 60</p>
<p>consecutive days;</p>
<p>(iv) detention of not more than one-half of one month&#x27;s pay</p>
<p>per month for three months;</p>
<p>(2) upon other personnel of his command--</p>
<p>(A) if imposed upon a person attached to or embarked in a vessel,</p>
<p>confinement on bread and water or diminished rations for not more</p>
<p>than three consecutive days;</p>
<p>(B) correctional custody for not more than seven consecutive</p>
<p>days;</p>
<p>(C) forfeiture of not more than seven days&#x27; pay;</p>
<p>(D) reduction to the next inferior pay grade, if the grade from</p>
<p>which demoted is within the promotion authority of the officer</p>
<p>imposing the reduction or any officer subordinate to the one who</p>
<p>imposes the reduction;</p>
<p>(E) extra duties, including fatigue or other duties, for not more</p>
<p>than 14 consecutive days;</p>
<p>(F) restriction to certain specified limits, with or without</p>
<p>suspension from duty, for not more than 14 consecutive days;</p>
<p>(G) detention of not more than 14 days&#x27; pay;</p>
<p>(H) if imposed by an officer of the grade of major or lieutenant</p>
<p>commander, or above--</p>
<p>(i) the punishment authorized under clause (A);</p>
<p>(ii) correctional custody for not more than 30 consecutive</p>
<p>days;</p>
<p>(iii) forfeiture of not more than one-half of one month&#x27;s</p>
<p>pay per month for two months;</p>
<p>(iv) reduction to the lowest or any intermediate pay grade,</p>
<p>if the grade from which demoted is within the promotion</p>
<p>authority of the officer imposing the reduction or any</p>
<p>officer subordinate to the one who imposes the reduction, by</p>
<p>an enlisted member in a pay grade above E-4 may not be</p>
<p>reduced more than two pay grades;</p>
<p>(v) extra duties, including fatigue or other duties, for not</p>
<p>more than 45 consecutive days;</p>
<p>(vi) restriction to certain specified limits, with or</p>
<p>without suspension from duty, for not more than 60</p>
<p>consecutive days;</p>
<p>(vii) detention of not more than one-half of one month&#x27;s pay</p>
<p>per month for three months.</p>
<p>Detention of pay shall be for a stated period of not more than one year</p>
<p>but if the offender&#x27;s term of service expires earlier, the detention shall</p>
<p>terminate upon that expiration.  No two or more of the punishments of</p>
<p>arrest in quarters, confinement or bread and water or diminished rations,</p>
<p>correctional custody, extra duties, and restriction may be combined to run</p>
<p>consecutively in the maximum amount impossible for each.  Whenever any of</p>
<p>those punishments are combined to run consecutively, there must be an</p>
<p>apportionment.  In addition, forfeiture of pay may not bee combined with</p>
<p>detention of pay without an apportionment.  For the purpose of this</p>
<p>subsection, &quot;correctional custody&quot; is the physical restraint of a person</p>
<p>during duty or nonduty hours and may include extra duties, fatigue duties,</p>
<p>or hard labor.  If practicable, correctional custody will not be served in</p>
<p>immediate association with persons awaiting trial or held in confinement</p>
<p>pursuant to trial by court-martial.</p>
<p>(c) An officer incharge may impose upon enlisted members assigned to the</p>
<p>unit of which he is in charge such of the punishment authorized under</p>
<p>subsection (b)(2)(A)-(G) as the Secretary concerned may specifically</p>
<p>prescribe by regulation.</p>
<p>(d) The officer who imposes the punishment authorized in subsection (b),</p>
<p>or his successor in command, may, at any time, suspend probationally any</p>
<p>part or amount of the unexecuted punishment imposed and may suspend</p>
<p>probationally a reduction in grade or forfeiture imposed under subsection</p>
<p>(b), whether or not executed.  In addition, he may, at any time, remit or</p>
<p>mitigate any part or amount of the unexecuted punishment imposed and may</p>
<p>set aside in whole or in part the punishment, whether executed or</p>
<p>unexecuted, and restore all rights, privileges and property affected.  He</p>
<p>may also mitigate reduction in grade to forfeiture or detention of pay.</p>
<p>When mitigating--</p>
<p>(1) arrest in quarters to restriction;</p>
<p>(2) confinement on bread and water or diminished rations to</p>
<p>correctional custody;</p>
<p>(3) correctional custody confinement on bread and water or diminished</p>
<p>rations to extra duties or restriction, or both; or</p>
<p>(4) extra duties to restriction;</p>
<p>the mitigated punishment shall not be for a greater period than the</p>
<p>punishment mitigated.  When mitigating forfeiture of pay to detention of</p>
<p>pay, the amount of detention shall not be greater than the amount of the</p>
<p>forfeiture.  When mitigating reduction in grade to forfeiture or detention</p>
<p>of pay, the amount of the forfeiture or detention shall not be greater than</p>
<p>the amount that could have been imposed initially under this article by the</p>
<p>officer who imposed the punishment mitigated.</p>
<p>(e) A person punished under this article who considers his punishment</p>
<p>unjust or disproportionate to the offense may, through proper channels,</p>
<p>appeal to the next superior authority.  The appeal shall be promptly</p>
<p>forwarded and decided, but the person punished may in the meantime be</p>
<p>required to undergo the punishment adjudged.  The superior authority may</p>
<p>exercise the same powers with respect to punishment imposed as may be</p>
<p>exercised under subsection (d) by the officer who imposed the punishment.</p>
<p>Before acting on appeal from a punishment of--</p>
<p>(1) arrest in quarters for more than seven days;</p>
<p>(2) correctional custody for more than seven days;</p>
<p>(3) forfeiture of more than seven days&#x27; pay;</p>
<p>(4) reduction of one or more pay grades from the fourth or a higher</p>
<p>pay grade;</p>
<p>(5) extra duties fro more than 14 days;</p>
<p>(6) restriction for more than 14 days; or</p>
<p>(7) detention of more than 14 days&#x27; pay;</p>
<p>the authority who is to act on the appeal shall refer the case to a judge</p>
<p>advocate or a lawyer of the Department of Transportation for consideration</p>
<p>and advice, and may so refer the case upon appeal from any punishment</p>
<p>imposed under subsection (b).</p>
<p>(f) The imposition and enforcement of disciplinary punishment under this</p>
<p>article for any act or omission is not a bar to trial by court-martial for</p>
<p>a serious crime or offense growing out of the same act or omission, and not</p>
<p>properly punishable under this article; but the fact that a disciplinary</p>
<p>punishment has been enforced may be shown by the accuse upon trial, and</p>
<p>when so shown shall be considered in determining the measure of punishment</p>
<p>to be adjudged in the event of a finding of guilty.</p>
<p>(g) The Secretary concerned may, by regulation, prescribe the form of</p>
<p>records to be kept under this article and may also prescribe that certain</p>
<p>categories of those proceedings shall be in writing.</p>
