<h1>SUBCHAPTER VIII. SENTENCES</h1><h3 id="855-art-55-cruel-and-unusual-punishments-prohibited">855. ART. 55. CRUEL AND UNUSUAL PUNISHMENTS PROHIBITED.<a class="article-anchor" href="#855-art-55-cruel-and-unusual-punishments-prohibited">#</a></h3><p>Punishment by flogging, or by branding, marking, or tattooing on the</p>
<p>body, or any other cruel or unusual punishment, may not be adjudged by a</p>

<p>use of irons, single or double, except for the purpose of safe custody, is</p>
<p>prohibited.</p><h3 id="856-art-56-maximum-limits">856. ART. 56. MAXIMUM LIMITS<a class="article-anchor" href="#856-art-56-maximum-limits">#</a></h3><p>The punishment which a court-martial may direct for an offense may not</p>
<p>exceed such limits as the President may prescribe for that offense.</p><h3 id="857-art-57-effective-date-of-sentences">857. ART. 57. EFFECTIVE DATE OF SENTENCES<a class="article-anchor" href="#857-art-57-effective-date-of-sentences">#</a></h3><p>(a) No forfeiture may extend to any pay or allowances accrued before the</p>
<p>date on which the sentence is approved by the person acting under section</p>
<p>860(c) of this title (article 60(c)).</p>
<p>(b) Any period of confinement included in a sentence of a court-martial</p>
<p>begins to run from the date the sentence is adjudged by the court-martial,</p>
<p>but periods during which the sentence to confinement is suspended or</p>
<p>deferred shall be excluded in computing the service of the term of</p>
<p>confinement.</p>
<p>(c) All other sentences of courts-martial are effective on the date</p>
<p>ordered executed.</p>
<p>(d) On application by an accused who is under sentence to confinement</p>
<p>that has not been ordered executed, the convening authority, or, if the</p>
<p>accused is no longer under his jurisdiction, the officer exercising general</p>
<p>court-martial jurisdiction over the command to which the accused is</p>
<p>currently assigned, may in his sole discretion defer service of the</p>
<p>sentence to confinement. The deferment shall terminate when the sentence is</p>
<p>ordered executed.  The deferment may be rescinded at any time by the</p>
<p>officer who granted it or, if the accused is no longer under his</p>
<p>jurisdiction, by the officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction</p>
<p>over the command to which the accused is currently assigned.</p><h3 id="858-art-58-execution-of-confinement">858. ART. 58. EXECUTION OF CONFINEMENT.<a class="article-anchor" href="#858-art-58-execution-of-confinement">#</a></h3><p>(a) Under such instructions as the Secretary concerned may prescribe, a</p>
<p>sentence of confinement adjudged by a court-martial or other military</p>
<p>tribunal, whether or not the sentence includes discharge or dismissal, and</p>
<p>whether or not the discharge or dismissal has been executed, may be carried</p>
<p>into execution by confinement in any place of confinement under the control</p>
<p>of any of the armed forces or in any penal or correctional institution</p>
<p>under the control of the United States, or which the United States may be</p>
<p>allowed to use.  Persons so confined in a penal or correctional institution</p>
<p>not under the control of one of the armed forces are subject to the dame</p>
<p>discipline and treatment as persons confined or committed by the courts of</p>
<p>the United States or of the State, Territory, District of Columbia, or</p>
<p>place in which the institution is situated.</p>
<p>(b) The omission of the words &quot;hard labor&quot; from any sentence of a court-</p>
<p>martial adjudging confinement does not deprive the authority executing that</p>
<p>sentence of the power to require hard labor as a part of the punishment.</p>
<p>858a. ART. 58a. SENTENCES: REDUCTION IN ENLISTED GRADE UPON APPROVAL</p>
<p>(a) Unless otherwise provided in regulations to be prescribed by the</p>

<p>(1) a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge;</p>
<p>(2) confinement; or</p>
<p>(3) hard labor without confinement;</p>
<p>reduces that member to pay grade E1, effective on the date of that</p>
<p>approval.</p>
<p>(b) If the sentence of a member who is reduced in pay grade under</p>
<p>subsection (a) is set aside or disapproved, or, as finally approved does</p>
<p>not include any punishment named in subsection (a)(1), (2), or (3), the</p>
<p>rights and privileges of which he was deprived because of that reduction</p>
<p>shall be restored to him and he is entitled to the pay and allowances to</p>
<p>which he would have been entitled for the period the reduction was in</p>
<p>effect, had he not been so reduced.</p>
