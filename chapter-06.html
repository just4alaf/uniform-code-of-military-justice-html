<h1>SUBCHAPTER VI. PRE-TRIAL PROCEDURE</h1><h3 id="830-art-30-charges-and-specifications">830. ART. 30. CHARGES AND SPECIFICATIONS<a class="article-anchor" href="#830-art-30-charges-and-specifications">#</a></h3><p>(a) Charges and specifications shall be signed by a person subject to</p>
<p>this chapter under oath before a commissioned officer of the armed forces</p>
<p>authorized to administer oaths and shall state--</p>
<p>(1) that the signer has personal knowledge of, or has investigated,</p>
<p>the matters set forth therein; and</p>
<p>(2) that they are true in fact to the best of his knowledge and</p>
<p>belief.</p>
<p>(b) Upon the preferring of charges, the proper authority shall take</p>
<p>immediate steps to determine what disposition should be made thereof in the</p>
<p>interest of justice and discipline, and the person accused shall be</p>
<p>informed of the charges against him as soon as practicable.</p>
<p>831 ART. 31. COMPULSORY SELF-INCRIMINATION PROHIBITED</p>
<p>(a) No person subject to this chapter may compel any person to</p>
<p>incriminate himself or to answer any questions the answer to which may tend</p>
<p>to incriminate him.</p>
<p>(b) No person subject to this chapter may interrogate, or request any</p>
<p>statement from an accused or a person suspected of an offense without first</p>
<p>informing him of the nature of the accusation and advising him that he does</p>
<p>not have to make any statement regarding the offense of which he is accused</p>
<p>or suspected and that any statement made by him may be used as evidence</p>
<p>against him in a trial by court-martial.</p>
<p>(c) No person subject to this chapter may compel any person to make a</p>
<p>statement or produce evidence before any military tribunal if the statement</p>
<p>or evidence in not material to the issue and may tend to degrade him.</p>
<p>(d) No statement obtained from any person in violation of this article,</p>
<p>or through the use of coercion, unlawful influence, or unlawful inducement</p>
<p>may be received in evidence against him in a trial by court-martial.</p><h3 id="832-art-32-investigation">832. ART. 32. INVESTIGATION<a class="article-anchor" href="#832-art-32-investigation">#</a></h3><p>(a) No charge or specification may be referred to a general court-martial</p>
<p>for trial until a through and impartial investigation of all the matters</p>
<p>set forth therein has been made.  This investigation shall include inquiry</p>
<p>as to the truth of the matter set forth in the charges, consideration of</p>
<p>the form of charges, and recommendation as to the disposition which should</p>
<p>be made of the case in the interest of justice and discipline.</p>
<p>(b) The accused shall be advised of the charges against him and of his</p>
<p>right to be represented at that investigation as provided in section 838 of</p>
<p>this title (article 38) and in regulations prescribed under that section.</p>
<p>At that investigation full opportunity shall be given to the accused to</p>
<p>cross-examine witnesses against him if they are available and to present</p>
<p>anything he may desire in his own behalf, either in defense or mitigation,</p>
<p>and the investigation officer shall examine available witnesses requested</p>
<p>by the accused.  If the charges are forwarded after the investigation, they</p>
<p>shall be accompanied by a statement of the substance of the testimony taken</p>
<p>on both sides and a copy thereof shall be given to the accused.</p>
<p>(c) If an investigation of the subject matter of an offense has been</p>
<p>conducted before the accused is charged with the offense, and if the</p>
<p>accused was present at the investigation and afforded the opportunities for</p>
<p>representation, cross-examination, and presentation prescribed in</p>
<p>subsection (b), no further investigation of that charge is necessary under</p>
<p>this article unless it is demanded by the accused after he is informed of</p>
<p>the charge.  A demand for further investigation entitles the accused to</p>
<p>recall witnesses for further cross-examination and to offer any new</p>
<p>evidence in his own behalf.</p>
<p>(d) The requirements of this article are binding on all persons</p>
<p>administering this chapter but failure to follow them does not constitute</p>
<p>judicial error.</p>
<p>833. ART.. 33. FORWARDING OF CHARGES</p>
<p>When a person is held for trial by general court-martial the commanding</p>
<p>officer shall, within eight days after the accused is ordered into arrest</p>
<p>or confinement, if practicable, forward the charges, together with the</p>
<p>investigation and allied papers, to the officer exercising general court</p>
<p>martial jurisdiction. If that is not practicable, he shall report in</p>
<p>writing to that officer the reasons for the delay.</p><h3 id="834-art-34-advice-of-staff-judge-advocate-and-reference-for-trial">834. ART. 34. ADVICE OF STAFF JUDGE ADVOCATE AND REFERENCE FOR TRIAL<a class="article-anchor" href="#834-art-34-advice-of-staff-judge-advocate-and-reference-for-trial">#</a></h3><p>(a) Before directing the trial of any charge by general court-martial,</p>
<p>the convening authority shall refer it to his staff judge advocate for</p>
<p>consideration and advice.  The convening authority may not refer a</p>
<p>specification under a charge to a general court-martial for trial unless he</p>
<p>has been advised in writing by the staff judge advocate that--</p>
<p>(1) the specification alleges an offense under this chapter;</p>
<p>(2) the specification is warranted by the evidence indicated in the</p>
<p>report of investigation under section 832 of this title (article 32) (if</p>
<p>there is such a report); and</p>
<p>(3) a court-martial would have jurisdiction over the accused and the</p>
<p>offense.</p>
<p>(b) The advice of the staff judge advocate under subsection (a) with</p>
<p>respect to a specification under a charge shall include a written and</p>
<p>signed statement by the staff judge advocate--</p>
<p>(1) expressing his conclusions with respect to each matter set forth</p>
<p>in subsection (a); and</p>
<p>(2) recommending action that the convening authority take regarding</p>
<p>the specification.</p>
<p>If the specification is referred for trial, the recommendation of the</p>
<p>staff judge advocate shall accompany the specification.</p>
<p>(c) If the charges or specifications are not formally correct or do not</p>
<p>conform to the substance of the evidence contained in the report of the</p>
<p>investigation officer, formal corrections, and such changes in the charges</p>
<p>and specifications as are needed to make them conform to the evidence, may</p>
<p>be made.</p><h3 id="835-art-35-service-of-charges">835. ART. 35. SERVICE OF CHARGES.<a class="article-anchor" href="#835-art-35-service-of-charges">#</a></h3><p>The trial counsel to whom court-martial charges are referred for trial</p>
<p>shall cause to be served upon the accused a copy of the charges upon which</p>
<p>trial is to be had.  In time of peace no person may, against his objection,</p>
<p>be brought to trial or be required to participate by himself or counsel in</p>
<p>a session called by the military judge under section 839(a) of this title</p>
<p>(article 39(a)), in a general court-martial case within a period of five</p>
<p>days after the service of charges upon him or in a special court-martial</p>
<p>within a period of three days after the service of the charges upon him.</p>
