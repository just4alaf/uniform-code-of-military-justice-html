<p>(1) general courts-martial, consisting of--</p>
<p>(A) a military judge and not less than five members; or</p>
<p>(B) only a military judge, if before the court is assembled the</p>

JURISDICTION OF COURTS-MARTIAL IN GENERAL<a class="article-anchor" href="#817-art-17-jurisdiction-of-courts-martial-in-general">#</a></h3><p>(a) Each armed force has court-martial jurisdiction over all persons</p>
<p>subject to this chapter.  The exercise of jurisdiction by one armed force</p>
<p>over personnel of another armed force shall be in accordance with</p>
<p>regulations prescribed by the President.</p>
<p>(b) In all cases, departmental review after that by the officer with</p>
<p>authority to convene a general court-martial for the command which held the</p>
<p>trial, where that review is required under this chapter, shall be carried</p>
<p>out by the department that includes the armed force of which the accused is</p>
<p>a member.</p><h3 id="818-art-18-jurisdiction-of-general-courts-martial">818. ART. 18. JURISDICTION OF GENERAL COURTS-MARTIAL<a class="article-anchor" href="#818-art-18-jurisdiction-of-general-courts-martial">#</a></h3><p>Subject to section 817 of this title (article 17), general courts-martial</p>
<p>have jurisdiction to try persons subject to this chapter for any offense</p>
<p>made punishable by this chapter and may, under such limitations as the</p>
<p>President may prescribe, adjudge any punishment not forbidden by this</p>
<p>chapter, including the penalty of death when specifically authorized by</p>
<p>this chapter.  General courts-martial also have jurisdiction to try any</p>
<p>person who by the law of war is subject to trial by a military tribunal and</p>
<p>may adjudge any punishment permitted by the law of war.  However, a general</p>
<p>court-martial of the kind specified in section 816(1)(B) of this title</p>
<p>(article 16(1)(B)) shall not have jurisdiction to try any person for any</p>
<p>offense for which the death penalty may be adjudged unless the case has</p>
<p>been previously referred to trial as noncapital case.</p>
<p>ART. 19. JURISDICTION OF SPECIAL COURTS-MARTIAL</p>
<p>Subject to section 817 of this title (article 17), special courts-martial</p>
<p>have jurisdiction to try persons subject to this chapter for any noncapital</p>
<p>offense made punishable by this chapter and, under such regulations as the</p>
<p>President may prescribe, for capital offenses. Special courts-martial may,</p>
<p>under such limitations as the President may prescribe, adjudge any</p>
<p>punishment not forbidden by this chapter except death, dishonorable</p>
<p>discharge, dismissal, confinement for more than six months, hard labor</p>
<p>without confinement for more than three months, forfeiture of pay exceeding</p>
<p>two-thirds pay per month, or forfeiture of pay for more than six months.  A</p>
<p>bad-conduct discharge may not be adjudged unless a complete record of the</p>
<p>proceedings and testimony has been made, counsel having the qualifications</p>
<p>prescribed under section 827(b) of this title (article 27(b)) was detailed</p>
<p>to represent the accused, and a military judge was detailed to the trial,</p>
<p>except in any case in which a military judge could not be detailed to the</p>
<p>trial, the convening authority shall make a detailed written statement, to</p>
<p>be appended to the record, stating the reason or reasons a military judge</p>
<p>could not be detailed.</p>
<p>820 ART. 20. JURISDICTION OF SUMMARY COURTS-MARTIAL</p>
<p>Subject to section 817 of this title (article 17), summary courts-martial</p>
<p>have jurisdiction to try persons subject to this chapter, except officers,</p>
<p>cadets, aviation cadets, and midshipman, for any noncapital offense made</p>
<p>punishable by this chapter.  No person with respect to whom summary courts-</p>
<p>martial have jurisdiction may be brought to trial before a summary court-</p>
<p>martial if he objects thereto.  If objection to trial by summary court-</p>
<p>martial is made by an accused, trial may be ordered by special or general</p>
<p>court-martial as may be appropriate.  Summary courts-martial may, under</p>
<p>such limitations as the President may prescribe, adjudge any punishment not</p>
<p>forbidden by this chapter except death, dismissal, dishonorable or bad-</p>
<p>conduct discharge, confinement for more than one month, hard labor without</p>
<p>confinement for more than 45 days, restrictions to specified limits for</p>
<p>more than two months, or forfeiture of more than two-thirds of one month&#x27;s</p>
<p>pay.</p><h3 id="821-art-21-jurisdiction-of-courts-martial-not-exclusive">821. ART. 21. JURISDICTION OF COURTS-MARTIAL NOT EXCLUSIVE<a class="article-anchor" href="#821-art-21-jurisdiction-of-courts-martial-not-exclusive">#</a></h3><p>The provisions of this chapter conferring jurisdiction upon courts-</p>
<p>martial do not deprive military commissions, provost courts, or other</p>
<p>military tribunals of concurrent jurisdiction with respect to offenders or</p>
<p>offenses that by statute or by the law of war may be tried by military</p>
<p>commissions, provost courts, or other military tribunals.</p>
