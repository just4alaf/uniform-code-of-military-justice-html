<p>the findings or sentence adjudged by the court, or with respect to any</p>
<p>other exercises of its or his functions in the conduct of the proceedings.</p>
<p>No person subject to this chapter may attempt to coerce or, by any</p>
<p>unauthorized means, influence the action of a court-martial or any other</p>
<p>military tribunal or any member thereof, in reaching the findings or</p>

<p>statements and instructions given in open court by the military judge,</p>
<p>president of a special court-martial, or counsel.</p>

<p>prosecute in the name of the United States, and shall, under the direction</p>
<p>of the court, prepare the record of the proceedings.</p>
<p>(b)     (1) The accused has the right to be represented in his defense</p>

<p>(B) by military counsel of his own selection if that counsel is</p>
<p>reasonably available (as determined under regulations prescribed under</p>
<p>paragraph (7)).</p>
<p>(4) If the accused is represented by civilian counsel, military</p>
<p>counsel detailed or selected under paragraph (3) shall act as associate</p>
<p>counsel unless excused at the request of the accused.</p>

<p>available&quot; for the purpose of paragraph (3)(B) and establish procedures for</p>
<p>determining whether the military counsel selected by an accused under that</p>
<p>paragraph is reasonably available.  Such regulations may not prescribe any</p>
<p>limitation based on the reasonable availability of counsel solely on the</p>
<p>grounds that the counsel selected by the accused if from an armed force</p>
<p>other than the armed force of which the accuse is a member.  To the maximum</p>
<p>extent practicable, such regulations shall establish uniform policies among</p>
<p>the armed forces while recognizing the differences in the circumstances and</p>
<p>needs of the various armed forces.  The Secretary concerned shall submit</p>
<p>copies of regulations prescribed under this paragraph to the Committees on</p>

<p>martial may be challenged by the accused or the trial counsel for cause</p>

<p>the trial counsel shall ordinarily be presented and decided before those by</p>
<p>the accused are offered.</p>

<p>a plea of guilty sets up matter inconsistent with the plea, or if it</p>

<p>to any part of the United States, or the Territories, Commonwealths, and</p>
<p>possessions.</p><h3 id="847-art-47-refusal-to-appear-or-testify">847. ART. 47. REFUSAL TO APPEAR OR TESTIFY<a class="article-anchor" href="#847-art-47-refusal-to-appear-or-testify">#</a></h3><p>(a) Any person not subject to this who--</p>
<p>(1) has been dully subpoenaed to appear as a witness before a court-</p>

<p>courts for that purpose.  Upon conviction, such person shall be punished by</p>
<p>a fine of not more than $500, or imprisonment for not more than six months,</p>
<p>or both.</p>
<p>(c) The United States attorney or the officer prosecuting for the United</p>
<p>States in any such court of original criminal jurisdiction shall, upon the</p>
<p>certification of the facts to him by the military court, commission, court</p>
<p>of inquiry, or board, file an information against and prosecute any person</p>
<p>violating this article.</p>
<p>(d) The fees and mileage of witnesses shall be advanced or paid out of</p>
<p>the appropriations for the compensation of witnesses.</p><h3 id="848-art-48-contempts">848. ART. 48. CONTEMPT&#x27;S<a class="article-anchor" href="#848-art-48-contempts">#</a></h3><p>A court-martial, provost court, or military commission may punish for</p>

<p>presence, or who disturbs its proceedings by any riot or disorder.  The</p>
<p>punishment may not exceed confinement for 30 days or a fine of $100 or</p>

<p>the case or, if the case is not being heard, an attorney competent to</p>
<p>convene a court-martial for the trial of those charges forbids it for good</p>
<p>cause.  If a deposition is to be taken before charges are referred for</p>
<p>trial, such authority may designate commissioned officers to represent the</p>
<p>prosecution and the defense and may authorize those officers to take the</p>
<p>deposition of any witness.</p>
<p>(b) The party at whose instance a deposition is to be taken shall give to</p>
<p>every other party reasonable written notice of the time and place for</p>
<p>taking the deposition.</p>
<p>(c) Depositions may be taken before and authenticated by any military or</p>
<p>civilian authorized by the laws of the United States or by the laws of the</p>

<p>(e) Subject to subsection (d), a deposition may be read in evidence or,</p>
<p>in the case of audiotape, videotape, or similar material, may be played in</p>
<p>evidence in any case in which the death penalty is authorized but is not</p>

<p>the rules of evidence, be read in evidence by any party before a court-</p>
<p>martial or military commission if the accused was a party before the court</p>
<p>of inquiry and if the same issue was involved or if the accused consents to</p>
<p>the introduction of such evidence.</p>
<p>(b) such testimony may be read in evidence only by the defense in capital</p>
<p>cases extending to the dismissal of a commissioned officer.</p>
<p>(c) Such testimony may also be read in evidence before a court of inquiry</p>
<p>or a military board.</p>
<p>* 850a. ART. 50a. DEFENSE OF LACK OF MENTAL RESPONSIBILITY</p>
<p>(a) It is an affirmative defense in a trial by court-martial that, at the</p>
<p>time of the commission of the acts constituting the offense, the accused,</p>
<p>as a result of a sever mental disease or defect, was unable to appreciate</p>
<p>the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of the acts.  Mental disease or</p>
<p>defect does not otherwise constitute a defense.</p>
<p>(b) The accused has the burden of proving the defense of lack of mental</p>
<p>responsibility by clear and convincing evidence.</p>
<p>(c) Whenever lack of mental responsibility of the accused with respect to</p>
<p>an offense is properly at issue, the military judge, or the president of</p>
<p>the court-martial without a military judge, shall instruct the members of</p>
<p>the court as to the defense of lack of mental responsibility under this</p>
<p>section and shall charge them to find the accused--</p>
<p>(1) guilty;</p>
<p>(2) not guilty; or</p>
<p>(3) not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility.</p>
<p>(d) Subsection (c) does not apply to a court-martial composed of a</p>
<p>military judge only.  In the case of a court-martial composed of a military</p>
<p>judge only, whenever lack of mental responsibility of the accused with</p>
<p>respect to an offense is properly at issue, the military judge shall find</p>
<p>the accused--</p>
<p>(1) guilty;</p>
<p>(2) not guilty; or</p>
<p>(3) not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility.</p>
<p>(e) Notwithstanding the provision of section 852 of this title (article</p>
<p>52), the accused shall be found not guilty only by reason of lack of mental</p>
<p>responsibility if--</p>
<p>(1) a majority of the members of the court-martial present at the time</p>
<p>the vote is taken determines that the defense of lack of mental</p>
<p>responsibility has been established; or</p>
<p>(2) in the case of court-martial composed of a military judge only,</p>
<p>the military judge determines that the defense of lack of mental</p>
<p>responsibility has been established.</p><h3 id="851-art-51-voting-and-rulings">851. ART. 51. VOTING AND RULINGS<a class="article-anchor" href="#851-art-51-voting-and-rulings">#</a></h3><p>(a) Voting by members of a general or special court-martial on the</p>
<p>findings and on the sentence, and by members of a court-martial without a</p>
<p>military judge upon questions of challenge, shall be by secret written</p>
<p>ballot.  The junior member of the court shall count the votes.  The count</p>
<p>shall be checked by the president, who shall forthwith announce the result</p>
<p>of the ballot to the members of the court.</p>
<p>(b) The military judge and, except for questions of challenge, the</p>
<p>president of a court-martial without a military judge shall ruse upon all</p>
<p>questions of law and all interlocutory questions arising during the</p>
<p>proceedings.  Any such ruling made by the military judge upon any question</p>
<p>of lay or any interlocutory question other than the factual issue of mental</p>
<p>responsibility of the accused, or by the president of a court-martial</p>
<p>without a military judge upon any question of law other than a motion for a</p>
<p>finding of not guilty, is final and constitutes the ruling of the court.</p>
<p>However, the military judge or the president of a court-martial without a</p>
<p>military judge may change his ruling at any time during the trial.  Unless</p>
<p>the ruling is final, if any member objects thereto, the court shall be</p>
<p>cleared and closed and the question decided by a voice vote as provided in</p>
<p>section 852 of this title (article 52), beginning with the junior in rank.</p>
<p>(c) Before a vote is taken of the findings, the military judge or the</p>
<p>president of a court-martial without a military judge shall, in the</p>
<p>presence of the accused and counsel, instruct the members of the court as</p>
<p>to the elements of the offense and charge them--</p>
<p>(1) that the accused must be presumed to be innocent until his guilt</p>
<p>is established by legal and competent evidence beyond reasonable doubt;</p>
<p>(2) that in the case being considered, if there is a reasonable doubt</p>
<p>as to the guilt of the accused, the doubt must be resolved in favor of the</p>
<p>accused and he must be acquitted;</p>
<p>(3) that, if there is reasonable doubt as to the degree of guilt, the</p>
<p>finding must be in a lower degree as to which there is no reasonable doubt;</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>(4) that the burden of proof to establish the guilt of the accused</p>
<p>beyond a reasonable doubt is upon the United States.</p>
<p>(d) Subsections (a), (b), and (c) do not apply to a court-martial</p>
<p>composed of a military judge only.  The military judge of such a court-</p>
<p>martial shall determine all questions of law and fact arising during the</p>
<p>proceedings, and, if the accused is convicted, adjudge an appropriate</p>
<p>sentence.  The military judge of such a court-martial shall make a general</p>
<p>finding and shall in addition on request find the facts specially.  If an</p>
<p>opinion or memorandum of decision is field, it will be sufficient if the</p>
<p>findings of fact appear therein.</p><h3 id="852-art-52-number-of-votes-required">852. ART. 52. NUMBER OF VOTES REQUIRED<a class="article-anchor" href="#852-art-52-number-of-votes-required">#</a></h3><p>(a)     (1) No person may be convicted of an offense for which the death</p>
<p>penalty is made mandatory by law, except by the concurrence of all the</p>
<p>members of the court-martial present at the time the vote is taken.</p>
<p>(2) No person may be convicted of any other offense, except as</p>
<p>provided in section 845(b) of this title (article 45(b)) or by concurrence</p>
<p>of two-thirds of the members present at the time the vote is taken.</p>
<p>(b)     (1) No person may be sentenced to suffer death, except by the</p>
<p>concurrence of all the members of the court-martial present at the time the</p>
<p>vote is taken and for an offense in this chapter expressly made punishable</p>
<p>by death.</p>
<p>(2) No person may be sentenced by life imprisonment or to confinement</p>
<p>for more than ten years, except by the concurrence of three-fourths of the</p>
<p>members at the time the vote is taken.</p>
<p>(3) All other sentences shall be determined by the concurrence of two-</p>
<p>thirds of the members at the time the vote is taken.</p>
<p>(c) All other questions to be decided by the members of a general or</p>
<p>special court-martial shall be determined by a majority vote, but a</p>
<p>determination to reconsider a finding of guilty or to reconsider a</p>
<p>sentence, with a view toward decreasing it, may be made by any lesser vote</p>
<p>which indicates that the reconsideration is not opposed by the number of</p>
<p>votes required for that finding or sentence.  A tie vote on a challenge</p>
<p>disqualifies the member challenged.  A tie vote on a motion for a finding</p>
<p>of not guilty or on a motion relating to the question of the accused</p>
<p>sanity. is a determination against the accused.  A tie vote on any other</p>
<p>question is a determination in favor of the accused.</p><h3 id="853-art-53-court-to-announce-action">853. ART. 53. COURT TO ANNOUNCE ACTION<a class="article-anchor" href="#853-art-53-court-to-announce-action">#</a></h3><p>A court-martial shall announce its findings and sentence to the parties</p>
<p>as soon as determined.</p><h3 id="854-art-54-record-of-trial">854. ART. 54. RECORD OF TRIAL<a class="article-anchor" href="#854-art-54-record-of-trial">#</a></h3><p>(a) Each general court-martial shall deep a separate record of the</p>
<p>proceedings in each case brought before it, and the record shall be</p>
<p>authenticated by the signature of the military judge.  If the record cannot</p>
<p>be authenticated by the military judge by reason of his death, disability,</p>
<p>or absence, it shall be authenticated by the signature of the trial counsel</p>
<p>or by that of a member if the trial counsel is unable to authenticate it by</p>
<p>reason of his death, disability, or absence.  In a court-martial consisting</p>
<p>of only a military judge the record shall be authenticated by the court</p>
<p>reporter under the same conditions which would impose such a duty on a</p>
<p>member under the subsection.</p>
<p>(b) Each special and summary court-martial shall keep a separate record</p>
<p>of the proceedings in each case, and the record shall be authenticated in</p>
<p>the manner required by such regulations as the President may prescribe.</p>
<p>(c)     (1) A complete record of the proceedings and testimony shall be</p>
<p>prepared--</p>
<p>(A) in each general court-martial case in which the sentence</p>
<p>adjudged includes death, a dismissal, a discharge, or (if the</p>
<p>sentence adjudged does not include a discharge) or any other</p>
<p>punishment which exceeds that which may otherwise be adjudged by</p>
<p>a special court-martial; and</p>
<p>(B) in each special court-martial case in which the sentence</p>
<p>includes a bad-conduct discharge.</p>
<p>(2) In all other court-martial cases, the record shall contain such</p>
<p>matters as may be prescribed by regulations of the President.</p>
<p>(d) A copy of the record of the proceedings of each general and special</p>
<p>court-martial shall be given to the accused as soon as it is authenticated.</p>
