ERROR OF LAW; LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSE<a class="article-anchor" href="#859-art-59-error-of-law-lesser-included-offense">#</a></h3><p>(a) A finding or sentence of court-martial may not be held</p>
<p>incorrect on the ground of an error of law unless the error</p>
<p>materially prejudices the substantial rights of the accused.</p>
<p>(b) Any reviewing authority with the power to approve or affirm</p>
<p>a finding of guilty may approve or affirm, instead, so much of</p>
<p>the finding as includes a lesser included offense.</p><h3 id="860-art-60-action-by-the-convening-authority">860. ART. 60. ACTION BY THE CONVENING AUTHORITY<a class="article-anchor" href="#860-art-60-action-by-the-convening-authority">#</a></h3><p>(a) the findings and sentence of a court-martial shall be</p>
<p>reported promptly to the convening authority after the</p>
<p>announcement of the sentence.</p>
<p>(b)     (1) the accused may submit to the convening authority</p>
<p>matters for consideration by the convening authority with respect</p>
<p>to the findings and the sentence.  Except in a summary court-</p>
<p>martial case, such a submission shall be made within 10 days</p>
<p>after the accused has been given an authenticated record of trial</p>
<p>and, if applicable, the recommendation of the staff judge</p>
<p>advocate or legal officer under subsection (d).  In a summary</p>
<p>court-martial case, such submission shall be made within seven</p>
<p>days after the sentence is announced.</p>
<p>(2) If the accused shows that additional time is required</p>
<p>for the accused to submit such matters, the convening authority</p>
<p>or other person taking action under this section, for good cause,</p>
<p>may extend the applicable period under paragraph (1) for not more</p>
<p>than an additional 20 days.</p>
<p>(3) In a summary court-martial case, the accused shall be</p>
<p>promptly provided a copy of the record of trial for use in</p>
<p>preparing a submission authorized by paragraph (1).</p>
<p>(4) The accused may waive his right to make a submission to</p>
<p>the convening authority under paragraph (1).  Such a waiver must</p>
<p>be made in writing and may not be revoked.  For the purposes of</p>
<p>subsection (c)(2), the time within which the accused may make a</p>
<p>submission under this subsection shall be deemed to have expired</p>
<p>upon the submission of such a waiver to the convening authority.</p>
<p>(c)     (1) The authority under this section to  modify the</p>
<p>findings and sentence of a court-martial is a matter of command</p>
<p>prerogative involving the sole discretion of the convening</p>
<p>authority.  Under regulations of the Secretary concerned, a</p>
<p>commissioned officer commanding for the time being, a successor</p>
<p>in command, or any person exercising general court-martial</p>
<p>jurisdiction may act under this section in place of the convening</p>
<p>authority.</p>
<p>(2) Action on the sentence of a court-martial shall be taken</p>
<p>by the convening authority or by another person authorized to act</p>
<p>under this section.  Subject to regulations of the Secretary</p>
<p>concerned, such action may be taken only after consideration of</p>
<p>any matters submitted by the accused under subsection (b) or</p>
<p>after the time for submitting such matters expires, whichever is</p>
<p>earlier.  The convening authority or other person taking such</p>
<p>action, in his sole discretion, may approve, disapprove, commute,</p>
<p>or suspend the sentence in whole or in part.</p>
<p>(3) Action on the findings of a court-martial by the</p>
<p>convening authority or other person acting on the sentence is not</p>
<p>required.  However, such person, in his sole discretion, may--</p>
<p>(A) dismiss any charge or specification by setting</p>
<p>aside a finding of guilty thereto; or</p>
<p>(B) change a finding of guilty to a charge or</p>
<p>specification to a finding of guilty to an offense that</p>
<p>is a lesser included offense of the offense stated in</p>
<p>the charge or specification.</p>
<p>(d) Before acting under this section on any general court-</p>
<p>martial case or any special court-martial case that includes a</p>
<p>bad-conduct discharge, the convening authority or other person</p>
<p>taking action under this section shall obtain and consider the</p>
<p>written recommendation of his staff judge advocate or legal</p>
<p>officer.  The convening authority or other person taking action</p>
<p>under this section shall refer the record of trial to his staff</p>
<p>judge advocate or legal officer, and the staff judge advocate or</p>
<p>legal officer shall use such record in the preparation of his</p>
<p>recommendation.  The recommendation of the staff judge advocate</p>
<p>or legal officer shall include such matters as the President may</p>
<p>prescribe by regulation and shall be served on the accused, who</p>
<p>may submit any matter in response under subsection (b).  Failure</p>
<p>to object in the response to the recommendation or to any matter</p>
<p>attached to the recommendation waives the right to object</p>
<p>thereto.</p>
<p>(e)     (1) The convening authority or other person taking</p>
<p>action under this section, in his sole discretion, may order a</p>
<p>proceeding in revision or a rehearing.</p>
<p>(2) A proceeding in revision may be ordered if there is an</p>
<p>apparent error or omission in the record or if the record shows</p>
<p>improper or inconsistent action by a court-martial with respect</p>
<p>to the findings or sentence that can be rectified without</p>
<p>material prejudice to the substantial rights of the accused.  In</p>
<p>no case, however, may a proceeding in revision--</p>
<p>(A) reconsider a finding of not guilty of any</p>
<p>specification or a ruling which amounts to a finding of</p>
<p>not guilty;</p>
<p>(B) reconsider a finding of not guilty of any charge,</p>
<p>unless there has been a finding of guilty under a</p>
<p>specification laid under that charge, which</p>
<p>sufficiently alleges a violation of some article of</p>
<p>this chapter; or</p>
<p>(C) increase the severity of some article of the</p>
<p>sentence unless the sentence prescribed for the offense</p>
<p>is mandatory.</p>
<p>(3) A rehearing may be ordered by the convening authority or</p>
<p>other person taking action under this section if he disapproves</p>
<p>the findings and sentence and states the reasons for disapproval</p>
<p>of the findings.  If such a person disapproves the findings and</p>
<p>sentence and does not order a rehearing, he shall dismiss the</p>
<p>charges.  A rehearing as to the findings may not be ordered where</p>
<p>there is a lack of sufficient evidence in the record to support</p>
<p>the findings.  A rehearing as to the sentence may be ordered if</p>
<p>the convening authority or other person taken action under this</p>
<p>subsection disapproves the sentence.</p>
<p>861. WAIVER OR WITHDRAWAL OF APPEAL</p>
<p>(a) In each case subject to appellate review under section 866</p>
<p>or 869(a) of this title (article 66 or 69(a)), except a case in</p>
<p>which the sentence as approved under section 860(c) of this title</p>
<p>(article 60(c)) includes death, the accused may file with the</p>
<p>convening authority a statement expressly waving the right of the</p>
<p>accuse d to such review.  Such a waiver shall be signed by both</p>
<p>the accused and by defense counsel and must be filed within 10</p>
<p>days after the action under sections 860(c) of this title</p>
<p>(article 60(c)) is served on the accused or on defense counsel.</p>
<p>the convening authority or other person taking such action, for</p>
<p>good cause, may extend the period for such filing by not more</p>
<p>than 30 days.</p>
<p>(b) Except in a case in which the sentence as approved under</p>
<p>section 860(c) of this title (article 60(c)) includes death, the</p>
<p>accused may withdraw an appeal at any time.</p>
<p>(c) A waiver of the right to appellate review or the withdrawal</p>
<p>of an appeal under this section bars review under section 866 or</p>
<p>869(a) of this title (article 66 or 69(a)).</p><h3 id="862-art-62-appeal-by-the-united-states">862. ART. 62. APPEAL BY THE UNITED STATES<a class="article-anchor" href="#862-art-62-appeal-by-the-united-states">#</a></h3><p>(a)     (1) In a trial by court-martial in which a military</p>
<p>judge presides and in which a punitive discharge may be adjudged,</p>
<p>the United States may appeal an order or ruling of the military</p>
<p>judge which terminates the proceedings with respect to a charge</p>
<p>or specifications or which excludes evidence that is substantial</p>
<p>proof of a fact material in the proceeding.  However, the United</p>
<p>States may not appeal an order or ruling that is, or amounts to,</p>
<p>a finding of not guilty with respect to the charge or</p>
<p>specification.</p>
<p>(2) An appeal of an order or ruling may not be taken unless</p>
<p>the trial counsel provides the military judge with written notice</p>
<p>of appeal from the order or ruling within 72 hours of the order</p>
<p>or ruling.  Such notice shall include a certification by the</p>
<p>(b) An appeal under this section shall be forwarded by means</p>
<p>prescribed under regulations of the President directly to the</p>
<p>Court of Military Review and shall, whenever practicable, have</p>
<p>priority over all other proceedings before that court.  In ruling</p>
<p>on an appeal under this section, the Court of Military review may</p>
<p>act only with respect to matters of law, notwithstanding section</p>
<p>866(c) of this title (article 66(c)).</p>
<p>(c) Any period of delay resulting from an appeal under this</p>
<p>section shall be excluded in deciding any issue regarding denial</p>
<p>of a speedy trial unless an appropriate authority determines that</p>
<p>the appeal was filed solely for the purpose of delay with the</p>
<p>knowledge that it was totally frivolous and without merit.</p><h3 id="863-art-63-rehearings">863. ART. 63. REHEARINGS<a class="article-anchor" href="#863-art-63-rehearings">#</a></h3><p>Each rehearing under this chapter shall take place before a</p>
<p>court-martial composed of members not members of the court-</p>
<p>martial which first heard the case.  Upon a rehearing the accused</p>
<p>may not be tried for any offense of which he was found not guilty</p>
<p>by the first court-martial, and no sentence in excess of or more</p>
<p>than the original sentence may be imposed unless the sentence is</p>
<p>based upon a finding of guilty of an offense not considered upon</p>
<p>the merits in the original proceedings, or unless the sentence</p>
<p>prescribed for the offense is mandatory.  If the sentence</p>
<p>approved after the first court-martial was in accordance with a</p>
<p>pretrial agreement and the accused at the rehearing changes his</p>
<p>plea with respect to the charges or specifications upon which the</p>
<p>pretrial agreement was based, or otherwise does not comply with</p>
<p>pretrial agreement, the sentence as to those charges or</p>
<p>specifications may include any punishment not in excess of that</p>
<p>lawfully adjudged at the first court-martial.</p><h3 id="864-art-64-review-by-a-judge-advocate">864. ART. 64. REVIEW BY A JUDGE ADVOCATE<a class="article-anchor" href="#864-art-64-review-by-a-judge-advocate">#</a></h3><p>(a) Each case in which there has been a finding of guilty that</p>
<p>is not reviewed under section 866 or 869(a) of this title</p>
<p>(article 66 or 69(a)) shall be reviewed by a  judge advocate</p>
<p>under regulations of the Secretary concerned.  A judge advocate</p>
<p>may not review a case under this subsection if he has acted in</p>
<p>the same case as an accuser, investigating officer, member of the</p>
<p>court, military judge, or counsel or has otherwise acted on</p>
<p>behalf of the prosecution or defense.  The judge advocate&#x27;s</p>
<p>review shall be in writing and shall contain the following:</p>
<p>(1) Conclusions at to whether--</p>
<p>(A) the court had jurisdiction over the accused and the</p>
<p>offense;</p>
<p>(B) the charge and specification stated an offense; and</p>
<p>(C) the sentence was within the limits prescribed as a</p>
<p>matter of law.</p>
<p>(2) A response to each allegation of error made in writing</p>
<p>by the accused.</p>
<p>(3) If the case is sent for action under subsection (b), a</p>
<p>recommendation as to the appropriate action to be taken and an</p>
<p>opinion as to whether corrective action is required as a matter</p>
<p>of law.</p>
<p>(b) The record of trial and related documents in each case</p>
<p>reviewed under subsection (a) shall be sent for action to the</p>
<p>person exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the</p>
<p>accused at the time the court was convened (or to that person&#x27;s</p>
<p>successor in command) if--</p>

<p>documents are sent under subsection (b) may--</p>
<p>(A) disapprove or approve the findings or sentence, in</p>
<p>whole or in part;</p>
<p>(B) remit, commute, or suspend the sentence in whole or</p>
<p>in part;</p>
<p>(C) except where the evidence was insufficient at the</p>
<p>trial to support the findings, order a rehearing on the</p>
<p>findings, on the sentence, or on both; or</p>
<p>(D) dismiss the charges.</p>
<p>(2) If a rehearing is ordered by the convening authority</p>
<p>finds a rehearing impracticable, he shall dismiss the charges.</p>
<p>(3) If the opinion of the judge advocate in the judge</p>
<p>advocate&#x27;s review under subsection (a) is that corrective action</p>
<p>is required as a matter of law and if the person required to take</p>
<p>action under subsection (b) does not take action that is at least</p>
<p>as favorable to the accused as that recommended by the judge</p>
<p>advocate, the record of trial and action thereon shall be sent to</p>
<p>Judge Advocate General for review under section 869(b) of this</p>
<p>title (article 69(b)).</p><h3 id="865-art-65-disposition-of-records">865. ART. 65. DISPOSITION OF RECORDS<a class="article-anchor" href="#865-art-65-disposition-of-records">#</a></h3><p>(a) In a case subject to appellate review under section 866 or</p>

REVIEW BY COURT OF MILITARY REVIEW<a class="article-anchor" href="#866-art-66-review-by-court-of-military-review">#</a></h3><p>(a) Each Judge Advocate General shall establish a Court of</p>
<p>Military Review which shall be composed of one or more panels,</p>
<p>and each such panel shall be composed of not less than three</p>
<p>appellate military judges.  For the purpose of reviewing court-</p>
<p>martial cases, the court may sit in panels or as a whole in</p>
<p>accordance with rules prescribed under subsection (f).  Any</p>
<p>decision of a panel bay be reconsidered by the court sitting as a</p>
<p>whole in accordance with such rules.  Appellate military judges</p>
<p>who are assigned to a Court of Military Review may be</p>
<p>commissioned officers or civilians, each of whom must be a member</p>
<p>of a bar of a Federal court or the highest court of a State.  The</p>
<p>Judge Advocate General shall designate as trial counsel that</p>
<p>appeal is not taken for the purpose of delay and (if the order or</p>
<p>ruling appealed is one which excludes evidence) that the evidence</p>

<p>prosecuted by appellate Government counsel.</p>
<p>(b) An appeal under this section shall be forwarded by a means</p>
<p>prescribed under regulations of the President directly to the</p>
<p>Court of Military Review and shall, whenever practicable, have</p>
<p>priority over all other proceedings before that court.  In ruling</p>
<p>on an appeal under this section, the Court of Military Review may</p>
<p>act only with respect to matters of law, notwithstanding section</p>
<p>666(c) of this title (article 66(c)).</p>
<p>(c) Any period of delay resulting from an appeal under this</p>
<p>section shall be excluded in deciding any issue regarding denial</p>

<p>knowledge that it was totally frivolous and without merit.</p>
<p>* 867. ART. 67. REVIEW BY THE COURT OF MILITARY APPEALS</p>
<p>(a) The Court of Military Appeals shall review the record in--</p>
<p>(1) all cases in which the sentence, as affirmed by a Court</p>
<p>of Military Review, extends to death;</p>
<p>(2) all cases reviewed by a Court of Military Review which</p>
<p>the Judge Advocate General orders sent to the Court of Military</p>
<p>Appeals for review; and</p>
<p>(3) all cases reviewed by a Court of Military Review in</p>
<p>which, upon petition of the accused and on good cause shown, the</p>
<p>Court of Military Appeals has granted review.</p>
<p>(b) the accused may petition the Court of Military Appeals for</p>
<p>review of a decision of a court of Military Review within 60 days</p>
<p>from the earlier of --</p>
<p>(1) the date on which the accused is notified of the</p>
<p>decision of the Court of Military Review; or</p>
<p>(2) the date on which a copy of the decision of the Court of</p>
<p>Military Review, after being served on appellate counsel of</p>
<p>record fro the accused (if any), is deposited in the United</p>
<p>States mails for delivery by first class mail to the accused at</p>
<p>an address provided by the accused, or, if no such address has</p>
<p>been provided by the accused, at the last address listed for the</p>
<p>accused in his official service record.  The Court of Military</p>
<p>Appeals shall act upon such a petition promptly in accordance</p>
<p>with the rules of the court.</p>
<p>(c) In any case reviewed by it, the Court of Military Appeals</p>
<p>may act only with respect to the findings and sentence as</p>
<p>approved by the convening authority and as affirmed or set aside</p>
<p>as incorrect in law by the Court of Military Review.  In a case</p>
<p>which the Judge Advocate General orders sent to the Court of</p>
<p>Military Appeals, that action need be taken only with respect to</p>
<p>the issues raised by him.  In a case reviewed upon petition of</p>
<p>the accused, that action need be taken only with respect to</p>
<p>issues specified in the grant of review.  The Court of Military</p>
<p>Appeals shall take action only with respect to matters of law.</p>
<p>(d) If the Court of Military Appeals sets aside the findings</p>
<p>and sentence, it may, except where the setting aside is based on</p>
<p>lack of sufficient evidence in the record to support the</p>
<p>findings, order a rehearing.  If it sets aside the findings and</p>
<p>sentence and does not order a rehearing, it shall order that the</p>
<p>charges be dismissed.</p>
<p>(e) After it has acted on a case, the Court of Military Appeals</p>
<p>may direct the Judge Advocate General to return the record to the</p>
<p>Court of Military Review for further review in accordance with</p>
<p>the decision of the Court.  Otherwise, unless there is to be</p>
<p>further action by the President or the Secretary concerned, the</p>
<p>Judge Advocate General shall instruct the convening authority to</p>
<p>take action in accordance with that decision.  If the court has</p>
<p>ordered a rehearing, but the convening authority finds a</p>
<p>rehearing impracticable, he may dismiss the charges.</p>

<p>of the Court of Military Appeals in refusing to grant a petition</p>
<p>for review.</p>

<p>66) shall be examined in the office of the Judge Advocate General</p>
<p>if there is a finding of guilty and the accused does not waive or</p>
<p>withdraw his right to appellate review under section 861 of this</p>
<p>title (article 61).  If any part of the findings or sentence is</p>
<p>found to be unsupported in law or if reassessment of the sentence</p>
<p>is appropriate, the Judge Advocate General may modify or set</p>
<p>aside the findings of sentence or both.</p>
<p>(b) The findings or sentence, or both, in a court-martial case</p>
<p>not reviewed under subsection (a) or under section 866 of this</p>
<p>title (article 66) may be modified or set aside, in whole or in</p>
<p>part, by the Judge Advocate General on the ground of newly</p>
<p>discovered evidence, fraud on the court, lack of jurisdiction</p>
<p>over the accused or the offense, error prejudicial to the</p>
<p>substantial rights of the accused, or the appropriateness of the</p>
<p>sentence.  If such a case is considered upon application of the</p>
<p>accused, the application must be filed in the office of the Judge</p>
<p>Advocate General by the accused on or before the last day of the</p>
<p>two-year period beginning on the date the sentence is approved</p>
<p>under section 860(c) of this title (article 60(c)), unless the</p>
<p>accused establishes good cause for failure to file within that</p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>(c) If the Judge Advocate General sets aside the findings or</p>
<p>sentence, he may, except when the setting aside is based on lace</p>
<p>of sufficient evidence in the record to support the findings,</p>
<p>order a rehearing.  If he sets aside the findings and sentence</p>
<p>and does not order a rehearing, he shall order that the charges</p>
<p>be dismissed.  If the Judge Advocate General orders a rehearing</p>
<p>by the convening authority finds a rehearing impractical, the</p>
<p>convening authority shall dismiss the charges.</p>
<p>*(d) A Court of Military Review may review, under section 866</p>
<p>of this title (article 66)--</p>
<p>(1) any court-martial case which (A) is subject to action by</p>
<p>the Judge Advocate General under this section, and (b) is sent to</p>
<p>the Court of Military Review by order of the Judge Advocate</p>
<p>General; and,</p>
<p>(2) any action taken by the Judge Advocate General under</p>
<p>this section in such case.</p>
<p>*(e) Notwithstanding section 866 of this title (article 66), in</p>
