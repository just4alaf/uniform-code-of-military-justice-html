# UCMJ – HTML Edition (Chapters 1–12)

This is a **GitHub Pages–ready** static site.

## Deploy Steps (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a new GitHub repo (public or private).
2. Upload all files from this folder to the repo root (including `.nojekyll`).
3. Go to **Settings → Pages**:
   - Source: `main` (or your default branch)
   - Folder: `/root`
4. Save; wait ~1–2 minutes for the site to go live.

## Optional: Custom Domain
- Add a `CNAME` file at the repo root with your domain name (e.g., `ucmj.example.com`).
- Then set a CNAME record at your DNS provider pointing to `<your-username>.github.io`.

## Local Viewing
Just open `index.html` in a browser.
